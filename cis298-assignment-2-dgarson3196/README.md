## Description

Create a temperature converter application.
The application should convert between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.
The application should look like the screen shots I have provided.
The application should do the calculation and display the formula that was used to do the calculation.
The calculation of the conversion should take place in a separate class
The application should handle errors gracefully.
The application should have a different layout for landscape form that looks like the one pictured here.
The application must retain it's information on the screen when rotated to landscape.

Solution Requirements:

* Convert between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin
* Looks like screen shots
* Calculate and display answer and formula
* Separate class for calculation
* Handle errors gracefully
* Separate Layout for landscape
* Retain information across rotation

### Notes

The book does not cover how to do work with Radio Buttons. I will talk about it as needed in class. If you are stuck or have questions about it, ask.
